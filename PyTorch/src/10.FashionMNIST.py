# This is about Fashion MNIST data base
# and how it is different from MNIST data set.

# Watch Andrej Karpathy's talk on Software 2.0
# The MNIST dataset, Modified National Institute of 
# Standards and Technology database, is a famous dataset of 
# handwritten digits that is commonly used for training image 
# processing systems for machine learning. 
# NIST stands for National Institute of Standards and Technology.
# The M in MNIST stands for modified, and this is because there 
# was an original NIST dataset of digits that was modified to give
# us MNIST. 

# Fashion-MNIST data set has a paper.
# has 10 classes. Is like a dirce drop in replacement of the MNIST.
