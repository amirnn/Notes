\section{Communication Paradigms}
    There are two Paradigms. These paradigms can be found in other robotic libraries as well.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Message-based Communication. Asynchronous. In this one node (or a program) sends a message to the other.
        \item Direct (shared) memory access. Much more efficient but it can have side effects if not treated carefully.
    \end{itemize}
