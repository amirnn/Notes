\section{Preface}
The notes here are from the lecture Visual Navigation for Flying Robots by Dr. JÃ¼rgen Sturm. 
\section{Communication Paradigms}
    There are two Paradigms. These paradigms can be found in other robotic libraries as well.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Message-based Communication. Asynchronous. In this one node (or a program) sends a message to the other.
        \item Direct (shared) memory access. Much more efficient but it can have side effects if not treated carefully.
    \end{itemize}
\section*{Forms of Communication}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Push. One sends a Message
        \item Pull. One asks for data
        \item Publisher/Subscriber
        \item Remote procedure calls / service calls. Similar to a pull action but we send some parameters too. It can be synchronous.
    \end{itemize}
